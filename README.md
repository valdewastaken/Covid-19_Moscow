R script to scratch data from https://coronavirus.mash.ru/ about COVID-19 cases in Moscow

It parses information about adress and date of the case and than provides coordinates to the adress, which makes possible making your own visualization of the cases.

__Warning!__

You need Yandex.maps API key to scratch coordinates. (Google API is possible, but works worse with Russian language)

Also I do not know primary source of data and if it reliable or not!
